# Training material

Training material for use when training customer analysts and administrators.
This material is meant to be generic enough to work across customers.
The first version will undoubtedly contain Telefonica specific parts.
When the course has been held and we know what works and what not we
can replace these parts with more generic placeholders.

The goal is to have this repo contain versions which are not customer
specific and can therefore be used across customers.

For the time being the material outline is kept in [Analyst workshop](Analyst%20workshop.md)
and [Admin workshop](Admin%20workshop.md) respectively.
